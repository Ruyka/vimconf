# Vim Awesome Configuration
This is my current Vim setting that I have spent days to come up with the bundles and the .vimrc file.

## Installation
### install curl
	sudo apt-get install curl
### run auto script
	git clone https://github.com/hkhoi/vimconf.git && \
	./vimconf/run.sh

## Note
One of the package here requires ctags. You just need to download it manually.

	sudo apt-get install ctags # for Ubuntu, Debian...

or

	sudo yum install ctags # for Fedora, CentOS...

## Tutorial
I will write a complete tutorial about this project, but not now. If you want to
learn more about keybindings, packages. just have a look at .vimrc. Thank you.
